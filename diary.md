### 07/10/2024 - 08/10/2024
Finished improving the project plan. I have also setup hosting for the final program and all of the proof of concepts that will be produced. This includes deno deploy for the websocket servers and aiven for the Valkey database.

### 08/10/2024 - 11/10/2024
Got more feedback from my supervisor for my project plan & made the improvements. Continued with screen designs & did further research into my chosen technologies (specifically Gleam) due to a misunderstanding of it's implementation of concurrency.

### 14/10/2024 - 16/10/2024
Setting up the technologies for my project on my machine (WSL, Deno, Gleam, etc.). Finishing off my screen designs.

### 17/10/2024 - 21/10/2024
Making screen designs something that will be worked on during the work on the rest of the goals on the timeline (this will help with understanding how to build what I want with my technologies).

Having a look at concurrency testing programs and a means to do TDD & documentation with my chosen technologies (I know you can do so (and well), but I just need to learn how).
